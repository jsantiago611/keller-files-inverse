In May 2023, Tim Keller passed away. 

This site is part dedication to him. And also part log of things that I learned throughout the years directly from his sermons, books, and talks. 
- Learn key points and gain insights you won't find anywhere else
- Understand Keller's best ideas
- Discover new connections between ideas

Enjoy,
Jon

p.s. Tim, we miss you.
