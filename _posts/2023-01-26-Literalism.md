### The Sermon in 3 sentences

1. Some people claim that they can’t trust in the Bible because it is historically unreliable and culturally regressive.
2. There are intellectually solid reasons we can and should trust the bible historically and culturally.
3. However, Your hearts are not going to be satisfied until you find him, and the way you find him is when in some particular Scripture text you see that it is really about him and what he has done.

### Impressions

This was a great reminder to me that Jesus truly is the center of the Biblical account. Reducing bible reading to an academic endeaver is a sure way to produce legalistic, cold-hearted people. But when I read it with Jesus in mind and what he has done for me, my heart is warmed and I am satisfied. 

### Who should listen to it?

I think you'll benefit from listening and studying this sermon if you think:

- There are many wonderful things in the Bible, but you shouldn't require that everyone believe and follow every word of it because some of its accounts are just incorrect — things that are **historically unreliable**.
- The Bible contains legends; we are unsure of what truly happened or what was actually spoken.
- The Bible encourages many outdated ideas and practices that are best left behind.
- The Bible does not hold the power to positively change a person.

### How the Sermon changed me



### My Top 3 Quotes

- _"I have been reading poems, romances, vision literature, legends, and myths all my life. I know what they are like. I know none of them are like this. Of this gospel text there are only two possible views. Either this is reportage…or else, some unknown ancient writer…without known predecessors or successors, suddenly anticipated the whole technique of modern novelistic realistic narrative (C.S. Lewis)_
- _If you're offended by something in the Bible, why should your cultural sensibilities trump everybody else's? Why should we get rid of the Bible because it offends your culture?_
- _You have in your heart a longing for purpose, a longing for infinite love, a longing for significance and security that nothing in this world can possibly satisfy. Your hearts are not going to be satisfied until you find him, and the way you find him is when in some particular Scripture text you see that it is really about him and what he has done._
