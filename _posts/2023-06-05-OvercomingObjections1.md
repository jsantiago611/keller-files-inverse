title: A text might not mean what we think it means
---

Anyone who reads the Bible will come across a text that offends them. In happened in ancient times as well, and Jesus commonly corrected people’s misunderstandings about what scripture teaches. We need to be patient with those texts that we may not understand. 

**Keller gives a personal example about reading the book of Genesis and being disappointed over how his spiritual heroes treated women:**

> Many years ago, when I first started reading the Book of Genesis, it was very upsetting to me. Here are all these spiritual heroes—Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph—and look at how they treat women. . . . They engage in polygamy, and they buy and sell their wives. It was awful to read their stories at times.
> 

**But he had a turning point:**

> But then I read Robert Alter’s The Art of Biblical Narrative. Alter is a Jewish scholar at Berkeley whose expertise is ancient Jewish literature. In his book he says there are two institutions present in the Book of Genesis that were universal in ancient cultures: polygamy and primogeniture. Polygamy said a husband could have multiple wives, and primogeniture said the oldest son got everything—all the power, all the money. In other words, the oldest son basically ruled over everyone else in the family. Alter points out that when you read the Book of Genesis, you’ll see two things. 

First of all, in every generation polygamy wreaks havoc. Having multiple wives is an absolute disaster—socially, culturally, spiritually, emotionally, psychologically, and relationally. 

Second, when it comes to primogeniture, in every generation God favors the younger son over the older. He favors Abel, not Cain; Isaac, not Ishmael; Jacob, not Esau. 

Alter says that you begin to realize what the Book of Genesis is doing—*it is subverting, not supporting, those ancient institutions at every turn.*

**This realization had an obvious impact:**

> When I read Alter’s book, I then reread the Book of Genesis and loved it. And then it hit me: What if when I was younger, I had abandoned my trust in the Bible because of these accounts in Genesis? What if I had drop-kicked the Bible and the Christian faith, missing out on a personal relationship with Christ—all because I couldn’t understand the behavior of the patriarchs? 

The lesson is simple: **Be patient with the text. Consider the possibility that it might not be teaching what you think it’s teaching.**
