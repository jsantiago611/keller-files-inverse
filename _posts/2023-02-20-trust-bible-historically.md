description: 3 Compelling Reasons the New Testament Documents Are NOT Myths or Legends
---

Many people say the NT accounts were “*concocted by the political winners… by church leaders who were trying to consolidate their power and build their movement”* and that we don’t really know what the real Jesus was like*.* 

3 reason you can trust what the Bible says about Jesus:

1. [[The New Testament Accounts of Jesus are written too early to be legends]].
2. [[The New testament documents are too counterproductive in their content to be legends]].
3. [[The New Testament Documents are too detailed in their form to be legends]].
