title: You can and should trust the Bible Culturally
---

Modern people are more troubled by the cultural aspects of the Bible than they are about the historical aspects of the Bible. They consider some parts good, but other parts primitive and regressive, and state that we can’t accept it today. If you come across offensive texts that make it hard for you to keep on exploring, accepting or living the Christian faith, ask 3 questions:

1. Does the text really mean what I think it means? (see [[A text might not mean what we think it means]])
2. Do I have cultural blinders on that are stopping me from seeing the text clearly?
3. If you’re offended by something in the Bible, why should your cultural sensibilities trump everybody else’s? Why should we get rid of the Bible because it offends your culture?
