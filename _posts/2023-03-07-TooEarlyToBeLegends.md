title: The New Testament Accounts of Jesus are written too early to be legends
tag: Myths Debunked

1. **Luke**, in writing his gospel, essentially says that you can check what he’s written with people that were still alive at the time of his writing. 
2. **Paul**, in writing his letters on 15-20 years after, mentions that one time Jesus appeared to 500 people at one time, and that you can still go talk to them. (1 Corinthians, Philippians )
3. They, along with other NT writers, prove that people were worshipping Jesus as God from the beginning. You could write documents hundreds of years later, and say whatever you wanted, because no one would be around to back the claim. But what the NT writers said were that you could happily verify their claims because it was an actual event that people saw. 
4. Therefore, The divinity of Jesus wasn’t a later development or legend that developed with time. 

Instead of writing of the gospels as myth and legends, [[You can and should trust the Bible Historically]].
